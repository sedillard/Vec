Synopsis:            Fixed-length lists and low-dimensional linear algebra.
Description:         
   Vectors are represented by lists with type-encoded lengths. The constructor
   is @:.@, which acts like a cons both at the value and type levels, with @()@
   taking the place of nil. So @x:.y:.z:.()@ is a 3d vector. The library
   provides a set of common list-like functions (map, fold, etc) for working
   with vectors. Built up from these functions are a small but useful set of
   linear algebra operations: matrix multiplication, determinants, solving
   linear systems, inverting matrices.
